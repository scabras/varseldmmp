\abstract{We consider the problem of variable selection in ordinary linear regression model where the number of covariates is larger than the sample size and big enough to prevent exploration of all possible models. In this context, a stochastic model exploration with Gibbs-sampling is usually performed and limited to models of size no larger than the sample size. Gibbs-sampling also incorporates evidence of Bayes Factors derived either from conventional priors or from non-local priors. The focus here is on the prior on model space for which we explore the use of the Dirichlet Process (DP) prior on the space of all possible models. Models posterior probabilities are approximated combining the DP prior and the output of the Gibbs-sampling.}

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations}
as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy
text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain
\textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original
publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manucript. The

captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

% For figures use
%
\begin{figure}[b]
\sidecaption

% For example, with the graphicx style use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
