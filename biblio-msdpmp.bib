	Abstract = {In Spain, the first bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) case was
	detected in 2000 in a cow born in the Galicia region (Northwestern
	Spain). From then and until October 2005, 590 cases were detected,
	223 of them in Galicia. In 1994, meat and bone meal (MBM) was banned
	on ruminant feed and, in 1996, an EU decision mandating an overall
	change in MBM processing was implemented. This decision was gradually
	applied in the territory and not enforced before July 1998. The objective
	of this study was to explore clustering of BSE cases and estimate
	the standard incidence ratio (SIR) of BSE in Galicia. Our study was
	based on the BSE cases detected during the surveillance period 2000-2005
	in the Galicia region. These cases were divided, based on birth date,
	into two periods: animals born from 1994 to July 1998, and those
	born after July 1998. We tested the role of cross-contamination on
	the geographical SIR distribution for both periods. Hierarchical
	Bayesian models were used to model the overdispersion and lack of
	independence of the SIR estimates. The geographical distribution
	of the standard incidence ratio of BSE between both periods was different.
	In the second period, the SIR was reduced in some areas. The reduction
	in these areas could be attributable to the changes in the processing
	of MBM. We did not find any statistical link between the poultry
	population and the standard incidence ratio, but pig population had
	a positive effect.},

	Abstract = {We consider that observations come from a general normal linear model
	and that it is desirable to test a simplifying null hypothesis about
	the parameters. We approach this problem from an objective Bayesian,
	model-selection perspective. Crucial ingredients for this approach
	are 'proper objective priors' to be used for deriving the Bayes factors.
	Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow priors have good properties for testing null
	hypotheses defined by specific values of the parameters in full-rank
	linear models. We extend these priors to deal with general hypotheses
	in general linear models, not necessarily of full rank. The resulting
	priors, which we call 'conventional priors', are expressed as a generalization
	of recently introduced 'partially informative distributions'. The
	corresponding Bayes factors are fully automatic, easily computed
	and very reasonable. The methodology is illustrated for the change-point
	problem and the equality of treatments effects problem. We compare
	the conventional priors derived for these problems with other objective
	Bayesian proposals like the intrinsic priors. It is concluded that
	both priors behave similarly although interesting subtle differences
	arise. We adapt the conventional priors to deal with nonnested model
	selection as well as multiple-model comparison. Finally, we briefly
	address a generalization of conventional priors to nonnormal scenarios.},

	Abstract = {For Hypothesis Testing and Model Selection, the Bayesian approach
	is attracting considerable attention. The reasons for this attention
	include: (i) it yields posterior probabilities of the models (and
	not simply accept-reject rules); (ii) it is a predictive approach;
	and (iii) it automatically incorporates the principle of scientific
	parsimony. Until recently, obtaining such benefits through the Bayesian
	approach required elicitation of proper subjective prior distributions,
	or the use of approximations (such as BIC) of questionable generality.
	In Berger and Pericchi (1996), the Intrinsic Bayes Factor Strategy
	was introduced, and shown to be an automatic default method corresponding
	to an actual (and sensible) Bayesian analysis. In particular, it
	was shown that the Intrinsic Bayes Factor yields an answer which
	is asymptotically equivalent to the use of a specific (and reasonable)
	proper prior distribution, called the Intrinsic Prior. Indeed, the
	IBF method can also be thought of as a method for constructing default
	proper priors appropriate for model comparisons. In this paper we
	study an implementation of the IBF strategy called the Median IBF.
	This seems to be a simple and very generally applicable IBF, which
	works well for nested or non-nested models, and even for small or
	moderate sample sizes; some of these situations can cause difficulties
	for other versions of IBFs.},

	various "default" Bayes factors, such as the fractional Bayes factor,
	the median intrinsic Bayes factor, and the encompassing and expected
	intrinsic Bayes factors. The different default methods are first
	compared with each other and with the p value in normal one-sided

	Bayes factors are also studied for specific models involving multiple

	involving a sequential clinical trial is discussed. In most of the

	Abstract = {In Bayesian analysis with a "minimal" data set and common noninformative
	priors, the (formal) marginal density of the data is surprisingly
	often independent of the error distribution. This results in great
	simplifications in certain model selection methodologies; for instance,
	the Intrinsic Bayes Factor for models with this property reduces
	simply to the Bayes factor with respect to the noninformative priors.
	The basic result holds for comparison of models which are invariant
	with respect to the same group structure. Indeed the condition reduces
	to a condition on the distributions of the common maximal invariant.
	In these situations, the marginal density of a "minimal" data set
	is typically available in closed form, regardless of the error distribution.
	This provides very useful expressions for computation of Intrinsic
	Bayes Factors in more general settings. The conditions for the results
	to hold are explored in some detail for nonnormal linear models and
	various transformations thereof.},

	Abstract = {Experiments using designs with complex aliasing patterns are often performed-for example, two-level nongeometric Plackett-Burman designs, multilevel and mixed-level fractional factorial designs, two-level fractional factorial designs with hard-to-control factors, and supersaturated designs. Hamada and Wu proposed an iterative guided stepwise regression strategy for analyzing the data from such designs that allows entertainment of interactions. Their strategy provides a restricted search in a rather large model space, however. This article provides an efficient methodology based on a Bayesian variable-selection algorithm for searching the model space more thoroughly. We show how the use of hierarchical priors provides a flexible and powerful way to focus the search on a reasonable class of models. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with four examples, three of which come from actual industrial experiments.},

	Abstract = {Model choice is a fundamental and much discussed activity in the analysis
	of data sets. Hierarchical models introducing random effects can
	not be handled by classical methods. Bayesian approaches using predictive
	distributions can, though the formal solution, which includes Bayes
	factors as a special case, can be criticized. We propose a predictive
	criterion where the goal is good prediction of a replicate of the
	observed data but tempered by fidelity to the observed values. We
	obtain this criterion by minimizing posterior loss for a given model
	and then, for models under consideration, select the one which minimizes
	this criterion. For a broad range of losses, the criterion emerges
	approximately as a form partitioned into a goodness-of-fit term and
	a penalty term. In the context of generalized linear mixed effects
	models we obtain a penalized deviance criterion comprised of a piece
	which is a Bayesian deviance measure and a piece which is a penalty
	for model complexity. We illustrate ...},

	Abstract = {Let X1, {\^a}‹¯, Xn be iid observations coming from an exponential
	family. The problem of interest is this: Given a finite number of
	models mj (smoothly curved manifolds in Rk), choose the best model
	to fit the observations, with some penalty for choosing models with
	dimensions which are too large. A result of Schwarz is made more
	specific and is extended to the case where the models are curved
	manifolds. If S(Y, n, j) is--up to a constant C(n) independent of
	the model--the log of the posterior probability of the jth model,
	where the sample mean Yn = (1/n){\^a}ˆ`n i=1Xi has been replaced
	by Y, Schwarz suggested an asymptotic expansion of S(Y, n, j) whose
	leading terms are $\gamma(Y, n, j) = n \sup_{\psi \in m_j \cap \Theta}(Y\psi
	- b(\psi)) - \frac{1}{2}k_j \log n$ , in the case where the models
	are affine subspaces of Rk. We establish a similar asymptotic expansion,
	including the next term, with uniform bounds for Y in a compact neighborhood
	of {\^a}ˆ‡ b({\^I}¸), where {\^I}¸ is the true value of the
	parameter. We suggest a criterion for the choice of the best model
	that consists of maximizing the three leading terms in the expansion

	Abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts
	typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed
	as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores
	the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences
	and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian
	model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting
	for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA
	have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number
	of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample
	predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently

	Abstract = {We propose a general Bayesian criterion for model assessment. The
	criterion is constructed from the posterior predictive distribution
	of the data, and can be written as a sum of two components, one involving
	the means of the posterior predictive distribution and the other
	involving the variances. It can be viewed as a Bayesian goodness-of-fit
	statistic which measures the performance of a model by a combination
	of how close its predictions are to the observed data and the variability
	of the predictions. We call this proposed predictive criterion the
	L measure, it is motivated by earlier work of Ibrahim and Laud (1994)
	and related to a criterion of Gelfand and Ghosh (1998). We examine
	the L measure in detail for the class of generalized linear models
	and survival models with right censored or interval censored data.
	We also propose a calibration of the L measure, defined as the prior
	predictive distribution of the difference between the L measures
	of the candidate model and the criterion minimizing model, and call
	it the calibration distribution. The calibration distribution will
	allow us to formally compare two competing models based on their
	L measure values. We discuss theoretical properties of the calibration
	distribution in detail, and provide Monte Carlo methods for computing
	it. For the linear model, we derive an analytic closed form expression
	for the L measure and the calibration distribution, and also derive
	a closed form expression for the mean of the calibration distribution.
	These novel developments will enable us to fully characterize the
	properties of the L measure for each model under consideration and
	will facilitate a direct formal comparison between several models,
	including non-nested models. Informative priors based on historical
	data and computational techniques are discussed. Several simulated
	and real datasets are used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.},

@article{KassRaf95,
	Abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed
	a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific
	theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor,
	which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior
	probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much
	discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism
	of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical
	tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss
	the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications
	in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize
	the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose
	of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific
	theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor
	of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating
	external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis.
	Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models
	to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes
	factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute
	using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods.
	In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC)
	gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor,
	which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions.
	When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors
	may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that
	a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account
	of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed
	that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class
	of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful
	for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important,
	and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior
	distributions used.},

	Abstract = {We examine the issue of variable selection in linear regression modelling, where we have a potentially large amount of possible covariates and economic theory offers insufficient guidance on how to select the appropriate subset. In this context, Bayesian Model Averaging presents a formal Bayesian solution to dealing with model uncertainty. Our main interest here is the effect of the prior on the results, such as posterior inclusion probabilities of regressors and predictive performance. We combine a Binomial-Beta prior on model size with a g -prior on the coefficients of each model. In addition, we assign a hyperprior to g , as the choice of g has been found to have a large impact on the results. For the prior on g , we examine the Zellner-Siow prior and a class of Beta shrinkage priors, which covers most choices in the recent literature. We propose a benchmark Beta prior, inspired by earlier findings with fixed g , and show it leads to consistent model selection. The effect of this prior structure on penalties for complexity and lack of fit is described in some detail. Inference is conducted through a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler over model space and g . We examine the performance of the various priors in the context of simulated and real data. For the latter, we consider two important applications in economics, namely cross-country growth regression and returns to schooling. Recommendations to applied users are provided. },

	Abstract = {In this paper we derive Schwarz's information criterion and two modifications
	for choosing fixed effects in normal linear mixed models. The first
	modification allows an arbitrary, possibly informative, prior for
	the parameter of interest. Replacing this prior with the normal,
	unit-information, prior of Kass \& Wasserman (1995) and the generalised
	Cauchy prior of Jeffreys (1961) yields the usual Schwarz criterion
	and a second modification, respectively. Under the null hypothesis,
	these criteria approximate Bayes factors using the corresponding
	priors to increased accuracy. In regression, the second modification
	also corresponds asymptotically to the Bayes factors of Zellner \&
	Siow (1980) and O'Hagan (1995), and is similar to the Bayes factor
	of Berger \& Pericchi (1996). In mixed models, the effective sample
	size term in Schwarz's formula is ambiguous because of correlation
	between observations. We propose an appropriate generalisation of
	Schwarz's approximation and apply our results to evaluate a large
	class of models for repeated neuron area measurements in alcoholic
	and suicidal patients. 10.1093/biomet/85.1.13},

	Abstract = {It is argued that P-values and the tests based upon them give unsatisfactory
	results, especially in large samples. It is shown that, in regression,
	when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable
	selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting
	a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate
	the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach
	to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model
	uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through
	the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can
	be done using the output from standard software. Specific results
	are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology.
	It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values
	and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows
	easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification
	of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence
	theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},
